# Section 4: Moving to the AWS Cloud 

As you learned so far in this module, cloud computing offers many advantages over the traditional model. However, for most organizations, cloud adoption does not happen instantly. Technology is one thing, but an organization also consists of people and processes, and these three elements must all be in alignment for successful cloud adoption. Cloud computing introduces a significant shift in how technology is obtained, used, and managed. It also shifts how organizations budget and pay for technology services. Cloud adoption requires that fundamental changes are discussed and considered across an entire organization. It also requires that stakeholders across all organizational units—both within and outside IT—support these new changes. In this last section, you learn about the AWS CAF, which was created to help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption.

## AWS Cloud adaption framework

Each organization’s cloud adoption journey is unique. However, in order for any organization to successfully migrate its IT portfolio to the cloud, three elements (that is, people, process, and technology) must be in alignment. Businessand technology leaders in an organization must understand the organization’s current state, target state, and the transition that is needed to achieve the target state sothey can set goals and create processes for staff.

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) provides guidance and best practices to help organizations identify gaps in skills and processes. It also helps organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing—bothacross the organization and throughout the IT lifecycle—to accelerate successful cloud adoption. 

At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives. Perspectives span people, processes, and technology. Each perspective consists of a set of capabilities, which covers distinct responsibilities that are owned or managed by functionally related stakeholders. 

Capabilities within each perspective are used to identify which areas of an organization require attention. By identifying gaps, prescriptive work streams can be created that support a successful cloud journey.

## Six core perspectives

In general, the Business, People, and Governance perspectivesfocus on business capabilities, while the Platform, Security, and Operations perspectivesfocus on technical capabilities.

### Business perspective

Stakeholders from the Business perspective (for example, business managers, finance managers, budget owners, and strategy stakeholders)can use the AWS CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives.Stakeholders should ensure that an organization’s business strategies and goals align with itsIT strategies and goals.

### People perspective

Stakeholders from the People perspective (for example, human resources, staffing, and people managers) can use the AWS CAF to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps. Performing an analysis of needs and gaps can help prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes to build an agile organization.

### Governance perspective

Stakeholders from the Governance perspective (for example, the Chief Information Officer or CIO, program managers, enterprise architects, business analysts, and portfolio managers) can use the AWS CAF to focus on the skills and processes that are needed to align IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals. This focus helps the organization maximize the business value of its IT investment and minimize the business risks.

### Platform perspective

Stakeholders from the Platform perspective (for example, Chief Technology Officer or CTO, IT managers, and solutions architects) use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships. They must be able to describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail. The AWS CAF includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and for migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

### Security perspective

Stakeholders from the Security perspective (for example, Chief Information Security Officer or CISO, IT security managers, and IT security analysts) must ensure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility. Security perspective stakeholders can use the AWS CAF to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organization’s needs.

### Operations perspective

Stakeholders from the Operations perspective (for example, IT operations managers and IT support managers) define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business isconducted. Stakeholdersfrom the Operations perspective align with and support the operations of the business. The AWS CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures.It also helps them identify the process changes and training that are needed to implement successful cloud adoption.
